</b><h1>Oak Tree</h1>
 An oak is a hardwood tree or shrub in the genus "Quercus" of the Beech family. They have spirally arranged leaves, often with lobed edges, and a nut called an acorn, borne within a cup. The genus is widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere; it includes some 500 species, both deciduous and evergreen.
 <h1>Maple Tree</h1>
 Most maples are trees growing to a height of 10–45 m. Others are shrubs less than 10 meters tall with a number of small trunks originating at ground level. Most species are deciduous, and many are renowned for their autumn leaf colour, but a few in southern Asia and the Mediterranean region are evergreen. Most are shade-tolerant when young and are often riparian, understory, or pioneer species rather than climax overstory trees.
 <h1>Pine Trees</h1>
Pine trees (Pinus) are evergreen, coniferous resinous trees (or, rarely, shrubs) growing 3–80 metres tall, with the majority of species reaching 15–45 m tall.
<h1>Birch Tree</h1>
A birch is a thin-leaved deciduous hardwood tree of the genus Betula in the family Betulaceae, which also includes alders, hazels, and hornbeams. It is closely related to the beech-oak family Fagaceae.
<h1>Willow Tree</h1>
Willows have abundant watery bark sap, which is heavily contained of salicylic acid, soft, usually pliant, tough wood, slender branches, and large, fibrous, often stoloniferous roots. The roots are remarkable for their toughness, size, and tenacity to live, and roots readily sprout from aerial parts of the plant.
<h1>Cedar Tree</h1>
Cedrus, with the common English name cedar, is a genus of coniferous trees in the plant family Pinaceae (subfamily Abietoideae). They are native to the mountains of the western Himalayas and the Mediterranean region.
<h1>Red Wood Tree</h1>
Sequoioideae, commonly referred to as redwoods, is a subfamily of coniferous trees within the family Cupressaceae, that range in the northern hemisphere. It includes the largest and tallest trees in the world. The trees in the subfamily are amongst the most notable trees in the world and are common ornamental trees. The subfamily reached its peak diversity in the early cenozoic period.
<h1>Fir Tree</h1>
Firs are evergreen coniferous trees belonging to the genus Abies (/ˈeɪbiˌiz/) in the family Pinaceae. There are approximately 48–65[2][3] extant species, found on mountains throughout much of North and Central America, Europe, Asia, and North Africa. The genus is most closely related to Cedrus (cedar).
